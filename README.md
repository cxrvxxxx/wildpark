Backend Framework: Django is a great choice for the backend, as it provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for web development with Python. It offers built-in support for handling routing, database management, authentication, and more. Django's robustness, scalability, and security make it suitable for building complex applications.

Database: For the database, you can consider using PostgreSQL with Django. PostgreSQL is a powerful and reliable relational database that integrates well with Django, offering advanced features, strong data integrity, and excellent scalability. It supports spatial data types and features, which can be beneficial for implementing location-based functionalities in your traffic management app.

API Development: Django REST framework is a popular choice for building APIs in Django. It provides a convenient way to create RESTful APIs, allowing you to define endpoints, handle data serialization, authentication, and more. This will enable your frontend React.js application to interact with the backend seamlessly.

Frontend Framework: React.js is an excellent choice for the frontend, as it allows for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture, efficient rendering through the virtual DOM, and a vibrant ecosystem of libraries and tools. React.js integrates well with Django, allowing you to consume the backend API and manage the presentation layer effectively.

State Management: For managing complex state within your React.js application, you can consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX. These libraries provide centralized state management, enabling efficient data flow and synchronization between components.

Map Integration: Since your app involves real-time traffic monitoring, integrating a mapping service can be beneficial. You can leverage Mapbox or Google Maps API to display traffic data, visualize parking spots, and provide geolocation functionality.
